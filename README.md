Meeech's fork of Matt Foster's zshkit fork
------------------------------------------

Some things will be tailored to my osx env. 

## Current issues:

* I haven't found a way to easily show when the repo is dirty.
* On my mac, opening additional zsh terminals doesn't give me coloured prompts.
* I keep seeing bits and bobs alluding to a 'new prompt colour' syntax, but I can't find any docs.
